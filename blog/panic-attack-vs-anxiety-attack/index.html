            <div class="article-body">
                <p>A panic attack is a sudden surge of intense fear that peaks within minutes, causing heart pounding, chest tightness, and a feeling of losing control — even without an obvious trigger. An anxiety attack, while not an official clinical term, describes a gradual buildup of worry and tension in response to a perceived stressor. The key difference: panic attacks ambush you, while anxiety attacks simmer.</p><h2 id="what-exactly-is-a-panic-attack">What Exactly Is a Panic Attack?</h2><p>The DSM-5 defines a panic attack as an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes. During that peak, at least four of these symptoms must be present: racing heart, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, chills or hot flashes, numbness, feelings of unreality, fear of losing control, or fear of dying.</p><p>Panic attacks can happen out of nowhere — during a meeting, while watching TV, even during sleep. They typically last 5 to 20 minutes, though some symptoms may linger longer. About 11% of Americans experience at least one panic attack per year, according to the <a href='https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/panic-disorder'>National Institute of Mental Health</a>.</p><h2 id="what-people-mean-by-anxiety-attack">What People Mean by 'Anxiety Attack'</h2><p>Unlike panic attacks, "anxiety attack" doesn't appear in any diagnostic manual. People use it to describe periods of heightened worry, restlessness, and physical tension that build over hours or days. You might feel your stomach churn before a big presentation, notice your shoulders creeping toward your ears during a stressful week, or find yourself unable to stop replaying a conversation.</p><p>The physical symptoms overlap with panic — muscle tension, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping — but they're less acute and more persistent. Think of it as a slow boil versus a flash fire.</p><h2 id="side-by-side-comparison">Side-by-Side Comparison</h2><h3>Onset</h3><p>Panic attacks arrive suddenly, often without warning. Anxiety attacks develop gradually as worry accumulates around a specific situation or thought pattern.</p><h3>Duration</h3><p>Panic peaks in under 10 minutes and usually resolves within 20 to 30. Anxiety can persist for hours, days, or weeks depending on the stressor.</p><h3>Trigger</h3><p>Panic attacks frequently have no identifiable trigger. Anxiety attacks almost always tie back to something specific — work deadlines, health concerns, relationship conflict.</p><h3>Intensity</h3><p>Panic attacks feel like a medical emergency. Many people end up in the ER convinced they're having a heart attack. Anxiety attacks are distressing but rarely produce that "I'm dying" sensation.</p><h2 id="when-panic-attacks-become-panic-disorder">When Panic Attacks Become Panic Disorder</h2><p>Having one panic attack doesn't mean you have panic disorder. The diagnosis requires recurrent unexpected attacks plus at least a month of persistent worry about having another attack, or significant behavioral changes to avoid them. About 2-3% of Americans meet criteria for panic disorder in a given year.</p><p>If you're experiencing <a href='https://anxiety.md'>generalized anxiety</a> alongside panic attacks, the two conditions often coexist. Treatment can address both simultaneously.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-during-a-panic-attack">What to Do During a Panic Attack</h2><p>Grounding techniques work because they interrupt the fight-or-flight cascade. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste. Slow your breathing — inhale for four counts, hold for four, exhale for six. Remind yourself that panic attacks, while terrifying, are not dangerous and will pass.</p><p>For managing ongoing anxiety, <a href='https://insomnia.md'>improving your sleep habits</a> can make a measurable difference, since sleep deprivation amplifies the amygdala's threat response by up to 60%, according to research from UC Berkeley.</p><h2 id="treatment-options-that-work">Treatment Options That Work</h2><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the gold standard for both panic disorder and generalized anxiety. A meta-analysis published in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em> found CBT produced large effect sizes for panic disorder, with gains maintained at follow-up. For panic specifically, interoceptive exposure — deliberately inducing physical sensations like rapid heartbeat through exercise — helps retrain the brain's threat detection.</p><p>SSRIs and SNRIs are first-line medications. Benzodiazepines provide fast relief but carry dependence risks and are generally reserved for short-term use. Many people benefit from a combination of therapy and medication, especially early in treatment.</p><p>If anxiety is affecting your daily functioning, understanding <a href='https://mental.md'>when to seek professional help</a> is worth your time.</p><h2 id="the-physical-health-connection">The Physical Health Connection</h2><p>Chronic anxiety doesn't just feel bad — it taxes the cardiovascular system. Prolonged cortisol elevation contributes to <a href='https://hypertension.md'>elevated blood pressure</a>, inflammation, and metabolic disruption. Addressing anxiety is genuinely a cardiovascular health decision, not just a mental health one.</p>
